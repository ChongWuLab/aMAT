# aMAT

aMAT is a computationally efficient and powerful method multi-trait association analysis. Compared with many existing methods, aMAT has two compelling features that make it potentially useful in many settings.

1. First, aMAT yields well-controlled Type 1 error rates when analyzing any number (e.g., hundreds) of traits. In contrast, many competing methods yield incorrect Type 1 error rates. 
2. Second, aMAT maintains high statistical power (often more powerful than competing methods) over a wide range of scenarios.

In this repo, we provide the following sources:

* aMAT: the software for running aMAT
* Codes: sources codes for replicating the results present in the following manuscript:  Chong Wu, Multi-trait genome-wide analyses of the brain imaging phenotypes in UK Biobank, Genetics, Under Revision.
